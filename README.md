This HTML document contains a form to input student details (name, roll number, and three marks) and a section to display the student data. The `Student` class is defined with a constructor to initialize student details and a method to calculate the average of the three marks. The `addStudent` function collects form data, creates a new `Student` object, calculates the average mark, and updates the display with the student's details. Input validation ensures all fields are filled before processing. The form is reset after each submission.
